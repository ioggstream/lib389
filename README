This repository contains tools and libraries for testing 389 Directory Server.

To run the tests you need:
 - run the test-setup script (please read the source!)
 - set some environment variables like PREFIX and PYTHONPATH
 # export PYTHONPATH+=":$PWD"
 # export PREFIX="$HOME/install"


On debian system you may need to:
 - fix this before compiling
#find ~/rpmbuild/ -path '*scripts/*.in' | grep ^source -l | xargs sed -e 's/^source /. /'
 - tweak CFLAGS & co to get rid of selinux and other missing libraries
